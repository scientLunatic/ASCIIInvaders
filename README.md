Weird little game


<h4>Short description:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Run invaders.exe on bin/Debug to play the game.</li>
</ul>
  

<p>Currently unsure if this runs on any other system but Windows(7)</p>

<p>main.c contains most of the code with "internal documentation".<br />
misc.c contains some interesting functions that could be used on several other applications</p>

<p>This, by any means, is not a serious project(as of the time this file was made).<br />
Any small(or big) mistakes should be pointed only for(possible) future reference.</p>
